            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>In the first, second, and third Verses, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet there complaineth, that <hi>the Lord had scattered them, and cast them forth: that hee had made the land to tremble, and shewed the people heavie things.</hi>

                  <p>In the 74. Psalm, the Prophet saith, <hi>Thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries roar in the middest of thy congregation, and set up their banners for signs.</hi>

                  <p>Out of which two places is set forth the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual combat betwixt God's children and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world, even till the world's end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may bee displaied becaus of the truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, wee are to consider who hath given this banner, namely, God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what this banner is: the flag of the Gospel Christ displaied <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, to whom it is given, namely to those that fear him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, to what end; That it may bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaied.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, for what caus; Becaus of the truth.</p>
                  <p>That the truth may bee stood for, <hi>Iude</hi> 3.</p>
                  <div n="1,2" type="parts">
                     <p>For the first, that God hath given a banner, is here plainly proved; it is without contradiction. Secondly, what the banner is; The flag of the Gospel: but here to <hi>David</hi> and his victorie.</p>
                     <p>Yet may it bee taken thus; That God will have a sign in all his children who stand for the truth of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>For seeing the banner is given to those that fear him; then it must follow, that both strong, weak, aged and lame, women and children, are for this spiritual combat.</p>
                     <p>A banner is a sign of such a Captain's companie: So likewise in a great citie, a man is sooner found where a sign is at his door. So in an armie, you can scarce finde a souldier but by his colors, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may hee bee from them; but not found with the enemies colors, for then, Death: neither may God's souldier bee from his colors.</p>
                     <p>For once from God's colors, presently with the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:204845:41"/>adversarie, no not under the greatest Monarch's standard that fight's against truth, to gain honor or riches: wee must boldly stand for truth.</p>
                     <p>In our spiritual warfare for truth and salvation, everie man is not to fight his own waie, when great differences arise. God's great Vicegerent is to call a Councel of War, and make chois of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, wise, and valiant Commanders, to train and make fit the souldiers to so weightie a service: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting godlie zeal, courage, faithfulness, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancie, as patterns to the souldiers: but first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen by the King of heaven, and then to bee countenanced by the Kings of the earth.</p>
                     <p>So have wee a blessed King, God's Vicegerent: For <hi>by Mee Kings reign.</hi> And under him Doctors, and Ministers, Collonels and Captains to teach us. The battel is like to go well, when the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are all skilful, faithful, valiant, and all of one minde. But desperately dangerous, where they are close traitors, cowards, and agree not in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: or so idle, as to set unskilful officers to train in their places; at least-wise so careless.</p>
                     <p>The enemies to sinceritie are so great, God's souldiers are so few; that wee may even crie with <hi>Elisha's</hi> servant, and saie, <hi>Alas master, what shall wee do?</hi> when hee saw the enemies manie, and they so few to fight against them. But wee must praie with <hi>Elisha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. that wee may have <hi>our eies opened to see</hi> the power of God, by his heavenlie hoste readie to fight for us: as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan</hi> and his armor-bearer; <hi>Ioshuah</hi> with his five Kings; and divers other places: so God fight's for his children that put their trust in Him, that they need not fear the number of their enemies, nor
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:204845:42"/>greatness of their persons; for if their quarrel bee God's, what should wee fear? Remember <hi>Herod</hi>'s great host, and God's little flock; but wee must bee sure to keep to God's rule, let us buckle on our armor, and match stoutly under our colors, for there was never more need.</p>
                     <p>Let us look to som of our Commanders, for the fight must need's bee dangerous, where anie Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains bee traitors, and the enemies best friends. They must bee all of one minde. In a temporal war there may bee peace concluded for a time; but in our spiritual war never anie peace. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies best friends, and so traitors, are all enemies to sinceritie, all close hypocrites, all opposers of the truth, and of God's children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But som will saie, Shall a private souldier meddle with Collonels or Captains, let him bee cashiered? I answer, hee may; nay, it is his dutie, if hee can finde either traitor, or coward in the band. I speak not this of anie in particular, but such as know these things to bee in themselvs: our Captains ought to train and teach us, wee must, give them their due, and they must tarrie with us and not leav us with unworthie and unskilful osh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as too manie do; get the living, and let the flock starv, or bee taken with the wolf. All that live in anie gross sin; as pride, drunkenness, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness, envie, swearing, Sabbath-breaking, idleness, or the like: these are not fit Captains to teach. There was never heard by anie ears, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect souldier, that was onely trained under anie of them; for hee that teacheth mee that I may not serv under the enemie, and assoon as hee hath taught mee will go sery him himself, is not worthie
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:204845:42"/>to have God's colors carried in his companie. For seeing wee are commanded to <hi>bee all of one minde,</hi> what shall becom of som of our Commanders that differ so much in opinion from our worthie antient ones, the blessed Martyrs: wee have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie worthie ones still hold together, and som differ but a little in a poor Ceremonie, a thing of nothing pertinent, in respect of a third sort that are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of us, that differ from the long taught Doctrine of our Church of <hi>England</hi> in manie Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>As our late King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memorie, hath declared himself against them, by his Book writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the States General of the United Provinces of the Low Countries, against Doctor <hi>Vorstius,</hi> in the year, 1612. <hi>It is</hi> (said His Majestie) <hi>one of the principal parts of that dutie which appertain's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Christian King, to protect the true Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own Dominions, and to extirpate Heresies, is a Maxim without all controversie; In which respect, those honorable Titles of</hi> Custos &amp; vindex utriusque Tabulae: <hi>Keeper and avenger of both the Tables of the Law.

                     <p>(Which title never Arminian had yet.) And further, in the same Book, writing to his Majesties Embassador at that time, to make unto them in his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:204845:43"/>Majesties name, of a Seditious, Heretical Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and not suffer anie of them to creep into their State. <hi>Our principal meaning was</hi> (said His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie) <hi>of Arminius, who, though himself were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyd ead, yet hee had left too manie of bis Disciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him.</hi> And more His Majestie said at the same time one <hi>Bertius</hi> a schollar of the late <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> was so shameless as to maintein in his Letter to the Archbishop, That the Doctrine conteined in his Book, was agreeable with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England. Let the Church of Christ then judg</hi> (said His Majestie) <hi>whether it was high time for us to bestir our selvs or no, when as this gangrene had not only taken hold amongst our nearest neighbors; so as not onely the next hous was on fire, but also began to creep into the bowels of our own Kingdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For before that time wee had no difference in Fundamental Points of our Religion, though som in Ceremonies. For whil'st we were striving about those gnats, the devil brought in these camels even readie to choak us. Thus differences amongst our selvs hath bred such distractions amongst manie, that they crie out, They know not what to do. Nay, even amongst good Christians, and a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate confusion amongst manie that are weak, so that som that have been accounted strong, have shut themselvs up, and lived with bread and water refusing all societie untill they died; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might have lived with great plentie. All this and more hath diversities of opinions wrought, which the devil and our main adversaries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I exhort you to bee ruled by our
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:204845:43"/>blessed Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. who spake by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghost, <hi>I beseech you brethren, by the name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that you all speak one thing: And that there bee no dissention amongst you, but bee knit together in one minde and in one judgment.</hi> Phil. 3.16.</p>
                     <p>Acts 4.32. <hi>The multitude of them that beleeved, were of one minde and one heart.</hi> So shall our war bee joiful and prosperous, and make our enemies to tremble, to see us hold together in the bands of amitie.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, seeing that the Almightie God that powerful Lord hath given us a banner, let our Commanders hold together, and teach one truth.</p>
                     <p>And souldiers stand close to their colors. Thus much of the first part.</p>
                     <p>God gave this banner here thou plain mai'st see:</p>
                     <p>A souldier faithful prove thy self to bee.</p>

                     <p>Then it must needs follow, that none are yet God's souldiers but those that fear him, yea, and love him too; they must go alwaies together like man and wife, that may not bee parted.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>But first of Fear.</head>
                        <p>Here it is plain, that strong men and lame, weak and sicklie, women and children, that fear God, are to fight under his colors.</p>
                        <p>Wee all made our Covenant with God in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism manfully to fight under the banner, against fin, the world, and the devil. <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.23. <hi>The fear of the Lord leadeth to life. It is an honor and

Not as worldlings do, in thunder, in wars, or famin, or the like, or fearful pestilence: but even when they receiv the greatest blessings; and as wee are to fear God truly, so must wee bee valiant to serv him against his enemies.</p>
                        <p>And if thou would'st bee truly valiant, First, <hi>learn to put on Christ Iesus, Rom.</hi> 13.14. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Get strength in the Lord, in the power of his might,</hi> Ephes. 6.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Put on the whole armor of God, that yee may bee able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For wee wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, the rulers of darkness; against spiritual wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness in high places.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The devil fight's chiefly at the head, the holie Ghost doubles the charge again, that <hi>wee take the whole armor of God, that wee may bee able to stand in the evil daie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And then beeing armed, keep true watch; for manie times weak souldiers by watchfulness, have resisted the enemie when stronger, by carelesness, have received the foil.

                        <p>When wee are thus armed, then the world, the flesh, and the devil, are at work to unarm us.</p>
                        <p>The flesh, by heat of lust to cast it off; the world, by her over-spreading sin of covetousness to hook it off; The Princes of this world, by pride and envie to pull it off. God cannot abide pride, no not in Kings: what? not in princely offices: Hee hate's it more then in the Clergie, they bring
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:204845:44"/>God no honor by it; so is it likewise in Envie, if it bee gotten in the Church, they are the devil's musicians to plaie him a dance. The fear of God rest's not where envie is, especially against since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, they are but whited walls, meer hypocrites: and where that sin of hypocrisie reign's, they will give consent to kill, or dismember, or displace anie of God's servants that offend them. They go as far as they dare for publick shame, mere rebels to God and all goodness; for <hi>they that strive to bee upright in his waie, they are an abomination to the wicked,</hi> Prov. 29.10. <hi>But the godlie praie for their souls.</hi>

Here would bee enough to fill officers purses; but that foul and execrable manner of Excommunicating for monie, came from the whore of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is no warrant out of God's Word for it: for it is chiefly against the poor with us, but the Pope will excommunicate Kings. It is either against thy brother that is, or may bee: Where is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Christ obeied, that thou shalt forgive him seven times?

                        <p>For God deal's with us as a good father having children in for eign countries where hee hear's som suffer imprisonment, som banishment som nakedness, som hunger, som one affliction, som another: Their loving father send's messengers to releas and reliev them with letters and directions of their waie, by such a river, by such a wood, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my instruction, com at the time appointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sun grow low, or bee set; and whereas I hear you suffer extremitie and miserie, you shall bee sure of joie and happiness.</p>

                        <p>Som go carelesly and sleepily to the colors, as if they care not whether they went or no; their love is not hot, they deceiv themselvs. Which put's mee in minde of a Storie once I read of two Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, <hi>That after manie passages, they came to a great and sumptuous castle, and viewing the walls and buildings, they saw a little Devil sleeping; and travelling on further, they found a poor man's hous, where they saw a monstrous raging Devil, somtimes tearing the thatch, somtimes the walls, and somtimes the windows: the one demanding of the other, why doth not the great devil go to the castle, and the little devil to the little hous; who answered, that the great devil had been at the great hous, and conquered all there alreadie, and had set the little devil to keep it; and might sleep too, but the poor man by God's unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistable grace stand's firm and keep's him at defiance.</hi>

                        <p>If this bee but a Fable the Moral may bee good; for the Lord respecteth not the persons that bee great that love him not: nor fail's the poorest that love him, and trust in him, and keep to his colors.</p>
                        <p>True love is the greatest blessing that ever God gave to man, and there was never anie perfect in love but one, which was <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly gave himself for us, which were his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; which tie's us all in love to give freely our lives to him again. Go to the first man that God made, who had free will, placed in <hi>Eden,</hi> which had both creatures and earth at his command, hee wanted love to fulfil the Law. <hi>Jacob</hi> likewise
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:204845:47"/>when he made a vow, <hi>That if the Lord would bless him in his journie, bee would build an Altar. Peter</hi> bragg'd and said, <hi>If all men forsake thee, yet my love is so, I will not:</hi> Which shew's, that wee are like dading children, not able to stand of our selvs; for when God take's away his hand of Grace, wee fall; then Grace is as it were rak't up in ashes, and wee fall; but of this more at large hereafter. Oh that God's children would hold together in peace and true love! for love grow's so cold in everie place, let mee tell thee, whosoever thou art, that hast not love to all God's children, examin but thy heart truly and thou canst not finde <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> there yet.</p>
                        <p>As manie can say, wee have so manie Sects of Religion amongst us, that there cannot bee that true love. Is it not lamentable to see our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains at variance, that their example should teach us love. <hi>By this shall all men know that you are my Disciples,</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>if you love one another; and by this wee know that wee are transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from death to life, if wee love the brethren.</hi>

Wee praie all together in God's hous for holiness and pureness of life, what greater hypocrisie can there bee as when wee never mean it; dissemble so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: if thou dealest but so with man, whose breath is in his nostrils; judg but thy self then what thou wilt bee accounted: Nay, when wee are out of God's hous, exclaim against them, which immediatly before thou did'st make request to God to bee one of.

                           <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is com into the world, and men love darkness rather then light, becaus their deeds are evil, John</hi> 3.19. Saie a man that hath but one daughter, that hath two suitors, the one truly honorable, virtuous, beautiful, comly, wise, in everie part exceeding and excelling the other; abounding in riches, promising to make her a jointure of a whole kingdom, and craving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but love.</p>
                        <p>The other suitor, true it is, was honorable, but now is proved a traitor, and so deprived of all his glorie hee lived in; becom a bankrupt, grown most ugly and mishapen, and one that hath no truth in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:204845:48"/>him, nor estate to make her; meaning that when hee hath won her alwaies to afflict her, and never to give her one hour of true comfort more: and shee, beeing well informed by her father of these two suitors before hand; if shee leav the best and take the worst, deserv's utterly to bee forsaken of her loving father, and never to bee taken for his childe again: but then, when the monster can prove a contract by her, and that shee hath served him more then an apprentice-ship, oh, then shee is fain to crie out to her father, It is true, O father! but I had no power of my self; help mee dear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for thou maiest yet help mee, help mee, or I am utterly undon and overthrown.</p>
                        <p>Thus stand's the case with most of us, <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> is our earnest suitor, who intreat's us by his sweet Epistles, his holie Word, his Embassadors, putting us daily in minde; yet wee refuse his kinde imbracements, his sweet societie, and to bee inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritors of the <hi>kingdom of heaven;</hi> to yield to the inticements of this uglie, monstrous, raging, both soul and bodie destroying suitor.</p>
                        <p>Now seeing it is so let us speedily with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal turn to our father, and fall at his feet, and never leav him until wee finde mercie; <hi>For love commeth af God, and everie one that loveth is born of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7. The onely waie to win us to this love to God is, First, sincerely to think what wee were without Christ, the basest of all creatures: they that love not Christ let them bee a <hi>Maranatha,</hi> that is, most accursed. Secondly, remember what wee are, if truly in him the most happie. And thirdly, meditate what hee hath don for us, at what a high rate hee hath purchased
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:204845:49"/>our love, by losing his life for us: this cannot but beget both love and thankfulness, without which, a man is no true Christian; want's thou this love to thy heavenlie suitor.</p>
                        <p>Look down upon the earth, what God for his sake hath don for thee; beholding it in the Spring, how it is bedecked with flowers fruit and riches, look on the pretious stones and gold, what reful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie there is in them, which God ordained for man: Then cast thine eies up to heaven, behold the Sun, Moon, and Stars, without which thou canst not move; these drawing thee on still to a more divine Meditation of heaven, which God will give to them that truly love him. Oh then meditate of our <hi>Saviour's Passion!</hi> how there was no sorrow like his sorrow, witness the drops of water and blood which hee swet for us; the nails through his blessed hands and feet, his pretious blood gushing out of his side, his chusing us from so manie thousand; still caring for us, when wee cannot care for our selvs. If thy love want heat, learn to increas it of the careful woman, who findeing but a small coal of fire in the ashes, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's little straws, small sticks, blow's softly, and findeing it to kindle, laie's on by degrees until shee hath made a strong and flaming fire. So praie for grace that thy love may increas until thou beest inflamed to thy Lord, and all his children.</p>
                        <p>So concluding this point with that of <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love mee, and those that seek mee early shall finde mee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, wee must consider whose words these were: the great God of heaven's who fail's not his promise.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, the effects; If wee love God hee will love us.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the comfort wee shall finde; an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting crown in heaven: which if it were on earth, would bee mixt with miserie.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the fearful and dangerous condition those are in that love not God.</p>
                        <p>For if an earthlie King should make such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and record it under his own hand; O what hasting! what striving there would bee to com before his presence to make profession of their love, though hee could give no certaintie to them of his life nor theirs, how long they should injoie his love, not one hour: How manie thousand years hath God proclaimed this sweet sentence, and how few com into his presence to declare themselvs. Then make use of those sweet succeeding words, <hi>Those that seek mee early shall finde mee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <q>
                           <l>And ceas not to seek him whil'st thou hast time and opportunitie,</l>
                           <l>And beg this Grace of Love, for it cannot bee bought with monie;</l>

                        <p>Which God truly shewed to us in sending his Son to redeem us, otherwise a lost people: then mourn that wee have neglected this heavenlie search so long.</p>

It is true that the professors of the Gospel have, in all ages, had by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names, and slanderous calumnies imposed upon them: as they have been called, <hi>Albingenses, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denses, Berengarians, Arnolists, Tossepines:</hi> and even in <hi>England</hi> in old time, <hi>Lollards,</hi> and <hi>Puritans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You may see the difference between the old <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans</hi> which were so indeed, and those that are nicknamed in these daies.</p>
                     <p>First, they named themselvs so, for a difference between themselvs and others orthodox: Wee are nicknamed so.</p>
                     <p>Secondly they called themselvs so through pride of their own pietie: Wee not so, but hate the name.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly they denied pardon of sin and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to them that fell through infirmitie; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied second Marriages: So do not wee.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they gloried in their own merits of works; So do not wee.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, they separated themselvs from other Orthodox Christians; So do not wee.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, they were condemned by Orthodox Fathers as Hereticks; So are not wee.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, som of them repented and returned again to the Church of God; Wee go not out from the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see the differences, how near they com together.</p>
                     <p>The one condemned as Hereticks; the other differs in nothing but in a poor Ceremonie, as wee
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:204845:51"/>our selvs call it. This I have heard taught by brave and conformable Captains of happie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>
                     <p>But the name of <hi>Round-heads</hi> proceeded neither from wit, grace, or godliness, and so not worth the answer; but, as it is reported from a condemned Jesuit.</p>
                     <p>A Long-head is like an Ass; a Logger-head is term'd a Fool; but sure they are the wisest heads that stand for truth.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, wee are to fight against the world, the flesh, and the devil; but not against God's faithful souldiers, though they differ in a small thing.</p>
                     <p>For (good Readers) if you observ, you will finde the devil's tract in this, as easily as to see a man's nose on his face; for first hee labor's to bring us out of love with them that conform not, by that fals name of <hi>Puritans;</hi> and then when those are shut out, to pick som quarrel against the most faithful as to term them Puritanical preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for our Saviour saith, <hi>There will bee differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces amongst you,</hi> (speaking to his own) <hi>even till the world's end;</hi> But not in manie points of Religion: for they are not of us that agree not with us in truth; especially those that refuse to hear and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themsels from their ordinances.</p>
                     <p>You see who wee are to make war against; this is no easie fight, though som Papists have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that the Protestant Religion, (as they call it) is the easiest Religion.</p>
                     <p>It may bee true, in a lazie licentious time-server, but not for a careful, vigilant, and true souldier of Christ. It is a hard task to mortifie the flesh with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:204845:52"/>the vain allurements of the world and to endevour to resist the inticements of the devil, as not to bee over-ruled by them; this will not bee found easie. Herein let us imitate the good warriour that keeps a Castle, wee must look to the breaches for let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the enemie, and when wee finde a breach weak and failing, presently do all wee can to strengthen it: whosoever undertake's this task will not finde it so easie a thing, though the joie it bring's will make al seem easie.</p>
                     <p>Now fourthly follow's the <hi>time;</hi> at all times; but chiefly when the enemie stir's most; on the Lord's-daie.</p>
                     <p>Wee must have our armor readie all the six daies, and watchful; but <hi>six daies shalt thou labor,</hi> and keep to thy Christian calling, but alwaies in Christ close to the banner: <hi>but the seventh date re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keep it holie,</hi> that thou must labor onely for thy soul. The seventh daie is alwaies the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test skirmish; for if wee call to minde the manie places in the sacred Scriptures, wherein wee are warned by God's fearful threatnings to sanctifie this daie and keep it holie; to get heavenlie wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to pitch all our thoughts and actions, to glorifie him, which ought to bee our chiefest care, which most are most careless in: Wee do not that which wee may do, but far from doing that which God command's, wee abuse the common graces which God give's us; wee labor not to improve our talent but make our legs lame to go to God's hous; our ears deaf to hear his word; our hearts otherwise affected; our eies blinde to see his word. Thus making our members rebels against our soul, and bring that woful sentence upon us; as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:204845:52"/>
                        <hi>Cursed is hee that doth the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently:</hi> so denying the waie to heaven, refusing God's chief blessings then our deserving is hell and damnation. For hee that is wearie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duties on the Lord's daie, and likewise daily duties constantly to bee performed in everie daie of the week must needs bee unfit for heaven where there is nothing but praising God.</p>
                     <p>Wee have manie brave out-side men that daie, for an hour in a daie, or an hour in a moneth, that seem to put on the <hi>breast-plate of righteousness,</hi> and with the <hi>sword of the spirit,</hi> cut sin to pieces; but when the hour is ended, there they leav the armor, sheath the sword, and roll the colors in the pulpit; and but for the out-side, shall not bee known to bee either Captains or Souldiers: nay, they will for that hour so rows up and awake sluggards, that the fore-named little devil is fain to call the great <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and tell him, if hee com not himself, his kingdom will bee thrown down, the field will bee lost: <hi>Beelzebub</hi> answer's, Thou sillie weakling canst thou perceiv nothing? these out-side men are my best friends, and do mee most service; let them alone one hour, they will bee for mee twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Mark but when a great man invite's one of them home on a Sabbath-daie to dine with him, where swearing, drinking, and beastlie talking is, what will hee saie then? doest thou hear him speak one word against mee then? no, hee will either join in outward action or in silence, and base co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardise, and fight manfully under my colors all the week after. What? dost thou not know yet that a forreign politick Prince hath his best friends in his adversaries Court and Counsel: nay there
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:204845:53"/>are too manie Captains and Souldiers that do in a manner make their Apologie to the Devil, and saie, Though wee may not for the<note n="*" place="margin">Nay the King of kings Law.</note> King's Law serv you in the daie, yet you had our hearts, for now at night wee com to offer our free service. How can a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier fight manfully when hee see's his Captain fight six daies with the Enemie, for one with his General; is not this pettie treason? Can the poor souldier think hee meaneth as hee taught him? It cannot bee true, think's hee, for then hee would never do so himself; what care and true love can hee have to my soul that hath so little to his town. Souldiers are too apt to follow their Leaders in evil, such a master, commonly such a man. Thus wee see that upon the Lord's-daie is the hottest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults both by the Devil and his followers.</p>
                     <p>The conscionable keeping of the Sabbath (saith Doctor <hi>Bailie</hi> in his <hi>Practice of Pietie) is the mother of Religion and good Discipline in the Church. Take away the Sabbath, and let men serv God as they list, and what will becom of Religion?</hi> Pag. 403.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The corruption of our nature is found in the manifest opposition of wicked men; and the secret unwillingness of the godlie, sincerely to keep the Sabbath, sufficiently sheweth the Commandement to bee Moral. These words are worthie to bee written in Letters of gold; for one blessed man's opinion on God's side should swaie more then
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:204845:53"/>never so manie against him. Holie <hi>Elijah,</hi> though a Prophet, said, Hee was left<note n="*" place="margin">Hee thought all had been slain but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> alone to worship God aright: yet God said to this holie Prophet, hee had yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served seven thousand that had not bowed the knee to <hi>Baal;</hi> but what was seven thousand amongst so manie millions of miscreants? though som great Doctors, they were never the holier in those daies for beeing Doctors. Labor to be good before thou beest great; for I saie if there were no more onely but that book called the <hi>Practice of Pietie,</hi> which is approved of by our Church, it were, I saie, a safer waie to hold to that Doctrine therein conteined, then to give ear to som late Writers, though<note n="*" place="margin">As to Dr. <hi>Pocklington.</hi>

                        <hi>And in tying to those daies God's worship: as, Praier, Fasting, and Merit:</hi>

                     <p>I speak not this to cast down the wonderful works of God that must bee kept in perpetual memorie.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable in the sacred Scriptures, That God never commanded anie thing which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law, but hee came himself to appoint it, who was the Law maker: as to have <hi>Abraham</hi> to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:204845:54"/>sacrifice his son, against the sixth Commandement. And likewise the children of Israel to rob the Egyptians, a breach of the seventh Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which otherwise had not onely been an abomination, but death: but beeing commanded by the Law maker, had been death eternal to have denied.</p>
                     <p>And more, our blessed Saviour beeing God, had given commandement unto the Apostles whom hee had chosen, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. to whom hee had presented himself alive after hee had suffered.</p>
                     <p>By manie infallible tokens, beeing seen of them by the space of fortie daies, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. and speaking of those things which appertain to the kingdom of God, even of all things. They, beeing directed by him, altered not the Commandement but the daie from the Jewish Sabbath to the first daie: which daie is renowned by our Saviour's Resurrection, which is the Queen of daies; <hi>In which</hi>

                        <hi>death is overcom, and life spring's up in glorie in Christ,</hi> which can no waie nullifie the Moralitie of it; for it was still God's proper act.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">The Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is of 2686 years standing.</note>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> commanded the Law to bee put into the Ark, that it might bee there for a witness against them; for said hee, <hi>I know your Rebellion; behold, I beeing yet alive; yee are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious against the Lord: how much more then after my death?</hi> Might not this great Prophet prophesie of these times, against those people that labor to make that Commandement (which the Lord put a <hi>memento</hi> too more then the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements) Ceremonial.</p>

                     <p>The Ceremonial Law was injoined to the <hi>Jews</hi> onely, but the Commandement of the Sabbath injoined as well to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Christ took the Curs of the Law from his redeemed, and God sanctified the Sabbath.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The Law is spiritual, but I am carnal.</hi> They then must needs be carnal that speak against the Moralitie of this Commandement, so then, it must needs agree with the flesh. The Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound's it in the margent, <hi>Of thine infidelitie:</hi> when thou shalt turn away from the Doctrine contained therein, which is now verified by som.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, (saith Dr. <hi>Bailie) The Church by an universal consent, even since the Apostle's time, hath still held the Commandement of the Sabbath Moral, and a perpetual Law of God; and the keeping of it upon the first daie of the week, to bee the institution of Christ and his Apostles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, it hath been the Law of our Church, as in the old Book of <hi>Common Praier, Incline our hearts to keep this Law.</hi> And our Saviour saith, <hi>I and my Father are one. If you love mee keep my Commandements, John</hi> 14.15, 21. twice repeating those words.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it was the order of our Church to have Evening Praier on Saturdaie, to prepare us for the holie Sabbath, that wee might bee fresh to go about that heavenlie work for our souls; for it will bee a great comfort to thy soul when thou art to depart this life, to think that thou hast striven against thy flesh to finde out the waie to heaven; which wicked men and malefactors have lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably cried out of their great abusing and wicked spending of God's holie Sabatth: so let everie one
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:204845:55"/>that loveth the Lord Christ keep holie the Lord's daie: for, saith the <hi>holie Ghost, Cursed is everie one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them:</hi> not to do his best endevour, and to flee to Christ for help. For the Commandements are holie, and just, and good; and it must needs bee a safe waie and most blessed so to hold, which the opposers will one daie finde.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The seventh daie is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God;</hi> this should make men take heed of intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against God that daie, if thou wilt have him to bee the Lord thy God, then endevour to keep his daie holie.</p>
                     <p>For if another keep his daie holie and thou dost not; What is that to thee?</p>

                     <p>But to whom did the Prophet speak these words? to the Jews onely? or from whom did hee speak, was it not from the Lord?</p>
                     <p>The Lord made not this Covenant with our Fathers onely, but with us; even with us all here alive this daie, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Psalm</hi> 105.8, 9, 10.</p>
                     <p>So it is plain, that God the Father spake all these words of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.1. God the Son came not to destroie the Law but to fulfil it. For said Hee, <hi>Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or title shall in no wise pass,</hi> Mat. 5.17, 18, 19. God the holie Ghost, <hi>laie's a curs upon everie one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not in all things which are written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. To endevour to his utmost to do them: so Christ fulfil's all for us if wee do our best.</p>
                     <p>Som, wee have, hold this fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bee Ceremonial, but most blessed men Moral.</p>
                     <p>Som approve of recreations, som not: Godlie recreations must needs bee lawful, but recreations which the flesh desire's cannot bee: They that can leap and dance, and sing, and still prais God, must needs bee lawful, but if our righteousness bee as a <hi>menstruous cloth,</hi> what then? <hi>See that you do all things according to the pattern, Heb.</hi> 8.5. Dance like <hi>David,</hi> sing like <hi>David,</hi> leap over the wall like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> but take heed of giving waie to lust like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> For the most part Recreations and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations are too contraries, wee may allow our selvs nothing, if before wee do it, wee know wee shall sin in it; neither eat or drink to sin; it is the best waie to hold the safe waie, for seeing our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is as rags, our reading, hearing, and our
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:204845:57"/>Praying, wee must needs bee careful when wee Praie.</p>
                     <p>Thus wee see the differences in all ages; keep still to the safe waie; none are commanded to use them; wee all praie for <hi>Holiness, without which none can see the Lord.</hi> Yet manie contemn the means, and will saie they hope to bee saved even as well as those that run after Sermons, and yet keep with <hi>Sir John</hi> their Parish Priest at home. These are like the sots that sit by the fire side, and crie for hunger, and will not rise to the table to fetch it: or like a slothful man in a room, having nothing there but weak and little food, and is invited to the next hous to strong and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening meat. So there bee manie that will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent often God's Hous, as long as they dwell near, so long as it may bee neither painful nor chargeable; but if the means bee removed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they will not stir one foot. This I saie again, that let a man conform to all that is required, if hee but abstain from drinking and ungodlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, and set himself to fear God, and but ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour so to keep the Lord's-daie, as hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, hee shall bee accounted a <hi>Puritan</hi> or <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;</hi> but if hee chance to fail in his profession of a Christian, and commit anie known sin, and will go on still in wickedness, then hee go's currant for an <hi>Hypocrite.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But against whom do you sport your selvs? &amp;c.</hi> Isa. 57.4, 20. <hi>The wicked are like the raging sea that cast's up dirt.</hi> but for all this, God's souldiers must not bee ashamed of their colors.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviour praied for his enemies that crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, for they knew not what they did; so must
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:204845:58"/>his redeemed do, they must praie for the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the opposers of the Truth if they belong to God, for they know not what they do; it is the honor of the Church. I personate none, but all those that know in their hearts that they love not all God's children; that love to profane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; that know they live in envie; that resolv to daie to give meetings to morrow, till they have drunk wit out of their heads, and grace out of their hearts, and health out of their bodies; that resolv to go on in wickedness still, and exclaim against those that labor to make conscience of their waies, and rank them amongst reprobates and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and plot how to mischief them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But such were som of you, but you are washed, but you are healed.</hi> I am sure such an one was I, and still too unworthie; (for I was forward in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness, and sorrie when the Minister staied us so long on the Sabbath-daie about God's service, and glad when all was ended, and have so wearied my self with vain and profane sports, even on the Lord's-daie, that I had not been able in five daies to use exercise again: nay, which was wors, when my self and my associates have been advised by those that feared God, to leav off those sports, wee have set them at defiance, and refused their good counsel.)</p>
                     <p>Therefore, <hi>I had rather go to the hous of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to have my sins taken off by true repentance, <hi>then to the hous of mirth,</hi> to have more laid on, seeing they are too heavie for mee alreadie, <hi>Psalm</hi> 38.4. Nay, where as God appoint's mee six daies for worldly occasions, I had rather have but five, then presumptuously to take half an
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:204845:58"/>hour of the seventh. Thus seeing Christ hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to disburden the penitent sinners, and that hee never refused to heal anie that truly and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily sought unto him for their bodilie cure, either lepers, or the like; surely, no more will hee denie us, if wee seek to have our souls cleansed from that foul taint and stain of hateful sin, hee will not fail us; if wee die to sin, and truly and earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to live to righteousness.</p>
                     <p>But to those that saie, I shall have peace, although I walk according to the stubbornness of my own heart, thus adding drunkenness to thirst.</p>
                     <p>The Lord will not bee merciful unto him, <hi>but then the wrath of the Lord and his jealousie shall smoak against that man, and everie curs that is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in this book shall light upon him, and the Lord shall put out his name from under heaven,</hi> Deut. 29.19, 20.</p>

                        <p>In the first place, wee must consider what Truth is.</p>
                        <p>God's Word written in the sacred Scriptures</p>
                        <p>In the second, who hath ever up-held it under God, and stood for it? His true Vicegerents his Prophets, his Martyrs, and Ministers.</p>
                        <p>And who hath withstood it? namely God's enemies.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, who are to follow them in their Doctrine and good example?</p>
                        <p>All that expect salvation; God's souldiers, his sheep.</p>
                        <p>First of the opposers; his enemies, the deniers of his truth, the opposers of his truth, and enemies of his truth, which the Devil hath ever stirred up, hath been the caus that manie millions of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands have lost their lives, som compulsively as soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, som voluntarily, as blessed Martyrs.</p>
                        <p>This antient spiritual combat first began in <hi>Eden,</hi> and never must end till the world end's. For no sooner had God given the first Commandement to <hi>Adam</hi> that hee should not eat of the forbiden fruit; For <hi>in the daie that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die:</hi> but presently said the Devil to the woman, <hi>Yee shall not surely die,</hi> until man by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience was banished the Garden. When God made the Commandements, written with the finger of God miraculously, which were Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Just and True; then the Devil must bee stirring against truth, making the People and Priest to commit Idolatrie, to make a golden Calf, (from which ground may com the Pope's Bulls) but let them know that presume to serv God otherwise then his Word allow's, are of a beastly generation,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:204845:59"/>though never so gilded; for when they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Idolatrous works, <hi>Moses</hi> cried out they were naked.</p>
                        <p>Nothing can hide our nakedness but God's truth; Christ's garment; the costliest cope in <hi>Rome</hi> cannot hide the nakedness of sin, though worn by a Friar: Thus you see the Commandements have been opposed by the Flesh and the Devil.</p>
                        <p>Seeking still to prevent the end of our creation, to stand for truth <hi>Ride upon the word of truth, Psalm</hi> 45.4. bee carried with it, bee supported by it, stand for it, die for it.</p>
                        <p>Isa. 26.2. <hi>Open the gates that the righteous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which keep's the truth, may enter. For</hi> (saith God) <hi>surely they are my people, children that will not lie.</hi> As they that have least grace care least for it; so those that have least truth stand most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. The greatest enemies to truth and the sinceritie of it, are in the greatest places, and with the greatest persons; the Devil presumed to com into the presence of God, nay, and sometimes seem's to stand for truth, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did for our Saviour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; till opportunitie gave leav, then give the sentence against truth, and would fain shut truth both out of Court and Courts, yea, and out of Countrie too. Seeing it is so, how valiant should both captain and souldiers bee?</p>
                        <p>God's Word is this truth which everie true warriour must stand for, which the enemies labor so much to denie and oppose; which wee (blessed bee God) have happily injoied amongst us, truly maintained, and couragiously stood for, which God ever still continue, that no man ought to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:204845:60"/>withstand; wee must bee all of one minde for truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.</p>

                        <p>To him or them, I answer.</p>
                        <p>The long and safe continuance of them by the hand of God, the manie opposers, the sweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordance of the Scriptures, the malice they shew to the Scriptures the heavenlie effects wrought by them in God's children, the terrors to the wicked, which they that question shall bee sure to finde if they repent not. and so much what Truth is.</p>

                        <p>Oh! but will som saie, What have you to do with truth? you are no Captain, you are but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldier, you have no calling to it: To them

The Schollar must repeat what hath been taught him; the Steward must give up his account; if it bee true, hee need not care who see's it: hee that hath been a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier more then five apprentiships, if hee cannot lead on a loos wing, or bee able a little to train in his Leaders absence, hee hath been negligent; but if hee know's not the quarrel, the truth of it, hee is but a fool; (hee must not bee like the sleepie Jurier that cried, hang six and save six.) As wee may not hide our talent, though it bee but poor; hee that love's the truth will stand to it, fall back, fall edg.</p>

                        <p>Ninthly, If one title of the Word of God may not bee altered; for saith the holie Ghost, Deut. 4.2. <hi>If anie man shall take away from the words of this book, Good shall take away his part out of the book of Life, Rev.</hi> 22.19. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.2. What shall becom of those that<note n="*" place="margin">They may the better saie, they can keep them.</note> leav out a whole Commandement, and take upon them to divide another to make up the number?</p>
                        <p>For the Pope hath in his Church but sixtie and six words in their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and they leav out above two hundred and fortie words as it stand's written in God's Book.</p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:204845:63"/>
                        <p>The tenth; for their meritorious works. The Prophet saith, <hi>All our righteousness is even as a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous cloth, and as rags:</hi> surely this cannot bee but a noisom ragged waie to merit heaven by, and as a holie man said, <hi>Wee are to ask God for everie bit of bread wee eat;</hi> and yet they think to get into heaven by good works, not regarding the words of the Apostle, <hi>When wee have don all wee can, wee are unprofitable servants.</hi> Mistaking holie <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> when hee endevoured to do Gods will, hee said, <hi>Remember mee, O my God, for good:</hi> hee said not, God reward mee for my deserts, for I have merited heaven.</p>
                        <p>The eleventh; <hi>Praie for your enemies,</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>Bless, I saie, and curs not, Tit.</hi> 1.8.</p>
                        <p>Curs them with <hi>Bell, Book,</hi> and <hi>Candle</hi> saith the Pope, for I command it that am above Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
                        <p>The twelfth; what shall I saie of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils, forbidding to Marrie? which God allow's; seeing <hi>Marriage is honorable to all, the bed beeing undefiled;</hi> no saith the Pope, Ministers shall not marrie, wee do rather allow Stews to them. Still they contradict God's Word.</p>
                        <p>The thirteenth; and that abomination of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Saints; when none but God know's the thoughts of the heart; here they must needs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, or make nothing worth the prayers of the heart; so that hee that hath no tongue to speak must think; farewel Saints, for I cannot bee saved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ely</hi> said, 1 Sam. 2.25. <hi>If a man sin against the Lord, who shall plead for him?</hi> Certainly if ever man might have shamed to have com before the Lord without a Mediator, <hi>David</hi> might; who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:204845:63"/>the Lord's bringing him from the sheep to the Scepter, committed Adulterie and then Murther.</p>
                        <p>Yet hee knew <hi>Abraham was ignorant of us, and Israel knew us not, Isa.</hi> 63.16. For (said hee) <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? Psal.</hi> 37.29. Certainly if these Men Saints know us not no Women Saints do; then vain must the Praier bee, as, <hi>Woman, command thy Son.</hi> As they put too much honor to the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> wee have som take too much from her: read <hi>Luke</hi> 1.43, 48. <hi>All generations must call her blessed:</hi> they were then to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that termed her like a saffron-bag.</p>
                        <p>Our Saviour must bee all in all, hee call's us all to him that are wearie of their sins, that finde them a burthen to them. The Prodigal went to his father, who was readie to imbrace him: it might have been, his brother, that grumbled at his entertainment would have failed him. If a subject had a great suit to his King, and hee knew that his King had made a Proclamation, that hee might freely com to His Majestie for hee would hear him; vain were it then for him to seek a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: as if a man should kneel down to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the master's presence, which was most absurd.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> But why should wee labor so in vain to those that denie the <hi>holie Scriptures,</hi> the fountain of all our knowledg, which our Religion is grounded upon; and theirs upon man's Invention.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> Becaus our love is to them; they were once of us, but now they seek our blood and curs us: just as the Proud man cannot indure to hear the Doctrine of Humilitie; the Envious man of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:204845:64"/>Charitie; the Licentious man of Chastitie; the Covetous man of Liberalitie; the Profane man of Sinceritie: no more can these monsters abide the sacred written Veritie, becaus the secret will of God is not revealed unto them.</p>
                        <p>The fourteenth, now of that presumptuous sin, in picturing the Almightie God, who saith, <hi>I am God, and there is nothing like mee, Psal.</hi> 113.5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 46.9. And when none on earth might behold his face and live, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20. yet they will pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture him like an old man graie-headed.</p>
                        <p>It were abominable to think, much more to write of the absurdities that might follow that fals interpretation.</p>
                        <p>If it were lawful (as we hold it is not) to picture our Creator, the greatest probabilitie is, hee was like to <hi>Adam</hi> at his first Creation, for hee was not created an old man, neither was our Saviour Jesus Christ: now becaus <hi>Daniel</hi> beholding the Lord in a Vision, calling him the <hi>Ancient of daies,</hi> and that the <hi>hair of his head was like the purest wool,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must needs bee graie: As if hee were not <hi>Alpha</hi> as well as <hi>Omega.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the God-head is not like gold graven by art and the invention of man: <hi>Put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness, Acts</hi> 17.29. Thus the holie Ghost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound's <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.20. If thou would'st bee like to God, endevour to kill everie sin, and increas in everie good thing which hee command's thee.</p>
                        <p>Certainly their Religion hath been but lately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, <hi>For hee is the same to daie as hee will bee to morrow: and a thousand years with him are but as one daie. With him there is no shadow of changing.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p>The fifteenth, for <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> I saie but this; If hee had ever read in the sacred Scriptures that ever our blessed Saviour had appeared to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Apostles or Disciples at one time in several places, then they might have been more confident of that Point.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the wise Preacher saith, <hi>And dust return to earth as it was, and the Spirit to God that gave it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>No saith the Pope, it go's to Purgatorie, believ, mee before the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>But I leav them to the more learned, and praie to God in his goodness that hee would open their eies, that they may speedilie turn to the Lord's colors for truth.</p>
                        <p>But for the seduced ones, I would wish my head a fountain, and mine eies rivers, truly to mourn more for them, that they would onely seek to God in Christ, and think not of their Merits that they may finde mercie, for <hi>they know not what they do.</hi>

                        <p>Now seeing Wolvs are crept in, and disquieted our Flock, which hath so long lain at rest, and scattered som that can scarce bee found again; it behoov's everie souldier to do his best to stand for Truth, that the flock may he at rest again. <hi>Wo bee unto those that destroie and scatter the sheep of my pasture, saith the Lord, Jer.</hi> 23.1, 2.</p>
                        <p>Now if I can give one blow to these disturbers of our Church and Peace, I shall think my self happie.</p>
                        <p>To pass by three of their Tenents and com one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to two which they plaie fals and quite out, as wee have been taught; and even as the great adversarie of ours, the Pope would have.</p>
                        <p>That of <hi>Universal Grace.</hi> That anie may bee saved that will.</p>
                        <p>And the other, <hi>That God's children may both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and finally fall awaie.</hi> Which cannot hold with God's truth.</p>
                        <p>First, these Tenents may well bee said to agree with the <hi>Flesh,</hi> that is with the carnal minded man.</p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:204845:65"/>
                        <p>Secondly, with the <hi>Devil.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, not with, but against the Doctrine of our <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, from the Law and Praiers of our <hi>Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, from the Peace of our <hi>Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Sixthly and lastly, from the Scriptures.</p>
                        <p>First, why they agree with the Flesh, that is the carnal minded man. Most are too apt to defer their repentance; then if anie man may bee saved that will, they will make that their last act when they make their will; for none would bee damned, their hopes of Mercie will give such libertie to Sensualitie.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, nothing can bee more pleasing to the Devil then defering repentance until the time of sickness, or som heavie affliction, then hee will hope to drive them to despair: everie Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an must praie for repentance, and lie at God's feet until hee gain it, and not think to obtein it when hee will.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, against the Doctrine of our Church; against both the tenth and seventeenth Article. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, against the Petition in the Lord's Praier, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi> And if the great glorious and onely Son of God, in whom all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness dwel't would not assume unto himself the power of <hi>Free-will;</hi> when hee fell on his face and praied, saying, <hi>O my Father, if it bee possible, let this cup pass from mee, nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 26.39. What? shall wee then the sinful seed of <hi>Adam</hi> have <hi>Free-will?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fifthly, From the Peace of our Church, for it
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:204845:66"/>breed's Distractions and sets men at variance, that manie poor souls know not what to pitch upon.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, against the Scriptures, for if anie man may bee saved that will, why did our Saviour teach by Parables, and answered his Apostles and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? <hi>It it given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven;</hi> Mat. 13.11, 15. <hi>but not unto them, lest they should bee converted.</hi> For the Church expound's it, the Gospel is hidden from them that perish; where is Free-will then?</p>
                        <p>Moreover (our Saviour saith) <hi>Two men shall bein the field, one shall bee received and the other refused. Two women grinding at the mill, the one shall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the other shall bee refused;</hi> not they will bee, but they shall bee: certainly if <hi>Solomon</hi> had had Free-will, his wisdom would have kept him from running into so much follie so long.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Manie shall bee purified and made white, Joh</hi> 32.8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.10. And saith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 6.44. <hi>None can com to mee except the Father which hath sent mee, draw him.</hi> Without mee yee can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Their righteousness is of mee, saith the Lord, Isa.</hi> 45, 17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To will in mee</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) is no good thing, by the grace of God, I am that I am: it is his mercie to give his grace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>God's grace is the ground and foundation of all goodness: Satan can do nothing to God's children without leav.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Paul</hi> beeing blindely led persecuted the Church of God; so are all persecuters of God's children.</p>
                        <p>But beeing called by Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. &amp; 3.8.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:204845:66"/>when grace was given him, hee then preached the waie to eternal life: Everie man is a beast in his own knowledg, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.14.</p>
                        <p>It is grace given which set's the will on work to goodness: God set's on work this habitual grace.</p>
                        <p>A father may give his childe his lands, but not grace; hee may use the means to beget grace in him: Repentance is the gift and work of God, a man cannot have will to repent without grace from God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.10.</p>

                        <p>It is grace that makes's thee hunger and thirst after righteousness,<note place="margin">God will not trust us with our own salvation.</note> to bee joiful of anie soul's happiness: Tell mee the holiest <hi>Arminian,</hi> canst thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

I should bee glad to know it by thee, but more joieful to finde it in my self. Wee must labor and use the means to get grace; as, Praier, reading God's Word, Meditation, and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for as hee that make's himself a night-bird cannot see the Sun, if hee shut himself in a close room: but look forth when the Sun shineth: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse not the Light, abuse not the common Graces; for God hath given to most men their sensitive parts and to discern betwixt good and evil. For this (som will saie) was a verie good Sermon, but such a man made a poor and sillie piece of work. These are common gifts and graces, but when hee hath given thee and mee hearts truly sorrowful for our sins, with endevouring to bee conscionable to amend what is amiss in us, this is the gift of God: Then learn of the careful Smith, strike whil'st the iron is hot; <hi>Quench not the Spirit, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise not Preaching,</hi> neglect not thy salvation.</p>
                        <p>Thus wee see manie have judgment to discern betwixt good and evil; but few have grace to take the good and refuse the evil; that is the gift of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Open thou my lips, and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise</hi> what? not till then, (O poor Free-will! For <hi>salvation belongeth to the Lord,</hi> Psal. 3.8. In actions, civil men have Free-will between man and man.</p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:204845:67"/>
                        <p>The ungodlie man that mainteineth Free-will (if there bee anie such) is unexcusable, if hee do not presently amend his life, it beeing (as hee saith) in his own power, why the Lord should ever bee merciful to him; nay, hee deserv's death to brave it so with God, as that hee will chuse when hee will bee saved. For if a Subject oppose his King and saie, I will rebel but till such a time, but then I will bee a faithful subject, which answer no King will take; so is it with all that hold Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, that are not holie people. <hi>Of his own good will hath hee begot us with the Word of truth.</hi>

                        <p>What must wee do then? use the means and beget grace at God's hand, that his Word of truth may beget us; for it shall accomplish what hee will have don. They can well agree with us to hold Church-livings by Hypocrisie, which they shew plainly as to bee of our Church, and hold Tenents quite contrarie: nay, they will seem to praie with us, and yet hold Tenents against those Praiers.</p>
                        <p>Grace to see our sins, and truly and heartily to repent, and so forsake them, is a mercie of mercies, when wee see by the eie of Faith that God hath blotted out the thick cloud of our transgressions, wee must return to God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.22.</p>
                        <p>Wee must endevour all wee may to grow in grace, and incline our hearts to perfect obedience to God's will for truth; for a hedg of his handie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work will keep the Devil out, when the greatest buildings and bulwarks of man's invention will let him in.</p>
                        <p>Thus I conclude, that a man must do his best,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:204845:68"/>and earnestly call upon God still for better abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And thus much of <hi>Free-will.</hi>

                        <p>Psalm 47.6. <hi>The Lord lifteth up the meek,</hi> Hee <hi>lasteth the wicked to the ground.

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, from his righteousness; that is, the fall opinion that hypocrites have of themselvs, <hi>for all our righteousness,</hi> that wee have of our selvs <hi>is as rags. But they that are born of God, sin not, for the Lord remaineth in them,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9.

                           <hi>Solomon</hi> asked wisdom of the Lord, and hee gave it him; hee asked not grace to guid his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; his hous was exceeding long of building, hee built a hous to serv God in, but begged not grace to keep God in his heart. <hi>Peter's</hi> hous was not finished of fifteen years, neither was <hi>David's</hi> of a long time.</p>
                        <p>A lim may bee rotted and ulcered, but as long as there is anie sound part, recovered again and made perfect, so it was with <hi>Solomon:</hi> but if it fall off quite, can never bee knit to again: So it must needs bee granted, that hee that finally fall's away was never a true member of Jesus Christ.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> but what saie you then to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> did they not fall wholly from God?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I answer as before; wee are all like dading-children, if God take away his grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand, wee fall. But first of <hi>Solomon,</hi> whose sin was greatest and continued longest; as I said, hee asked wisdom to govern his world of people, but not grace to govern his numberless sins. Yet God promised him, saying, <hi>I will bee his father, and hee shall bee my son,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14.19. <hi>And if hee sin,</hi> (which God knew hee would) <hi>I will chastise him with the rod of men, and with the plagues of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men; but my mercie shall not depart from him.</hi> As if hee should saie, Is it so <hi>Solomon</hi> that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:204845:69"/>thou askedst not grace when thou praiedst for wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that all the world admire's thee for the same; I will take away my hand, that all the <hi>Free-Willians</hi> that shall bee in the world may see what the wisest men are of themselvs. Yet, my mercie will I not take from thee; for the seed of God was in him: Our Saviour call's his father the <hi>husband-man.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As the husband-man soweth som wheat in som ground, that it lieth all Winter before it appear to have life, yet it hath life all Winter; so was it with <hi>Solomon,</hi> whil'st hee gave his heart to know all things: but when the spring came, that the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of Grace shined in his heart, Hee cried, <hi>All is vanitie:</hi> then his wheat sprung up and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
                        <p>Even so God's seed in <hi>David</hi> grew up, untill hee arose from his couch, and gave but waie to eas and idleness; then walking upon his palace, not checking his lustful eie, when hee beheld <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> brought by the Devils bait; &amp; then God took away his hand, and his fall was fearful. Then the Lord sent a storm, with a mightie winde and snow, which covered and overwhelmed his flourishing corn that it could not bee seen, yet there was corn; for when God dissolved the snow with that warm sun-shine of the Prophet <hi>Nathan's</hi> counsel, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering to him the foulness of his offence to his good God; then did his corn flourish and grow ripe even for the Lord's harvest; then hee cried, <hi>Make mee to hear joie and gladness, that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice:</hi> for still the seed of God remain's in the childe of God; there is strength and life, though hee fall hee shall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:204845:69"/>bee cast off, for the Lord put's under his hand. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.24.</p>
                        <p>Thus you see the <hi>Arminian</hi> to bee the greater non-conformitant, shaking hands in these Points with the <hi>Pope;</hi> and differ's in the Doctrine of our blessed Church.</p>
                        <p>Now, they amongst them that hold the Jews must keep the Sabbath, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 16, 17. and that wee may keep it, as if it were in our choice: they, I say, that hold so, may hold that they may go to Hell if they will, but can have little comfort that they may go to Heaven until they change their minde, in holding close to God's most blessed Law. And thus much against <hi>Arminians.</hi>

Tell mee, I praie thee, what thou hast proved thy self to bee? thus I answer thy first accusation, and prove it fals, for our <hi>Bishops</hi> did did not chiefly ordein Ministers; it is the Lord and not man. <hi>Bishops</hi> are but the admitters of them into the Church when they finde them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: if they admit of anie unworthie, if they know it, that lie's upon their own account and peril.</p>

                        <p>For, as I said, it is the Lord; look into <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Before thou camest out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a Prophet, Luke</hi> 1.15. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over our Saviour chose his Apostles, and likewise <hi>Paul,</hi> which must go to <hi>Ananias:</hi> As Marriages are made in Heaven, if with God's consent, that is, when there is a heavenlie choice, beeing joined together by God's appointment: The Marriage by the Minister, though it bee an honorable ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, doth but give satisfaction to the world, the Marriage was made before.</p>
                        <p>So thou followest not the example of Jesus Christ, nor yet the holie Ghost. <hi>Paul</hi> went three Sabbath daies into the Jew's Synagogue to dispute, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.1, 2. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> went up together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple at the time of Praier, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. to the 15. vers. Wee are taught indeed <hi>to separate our selvs,</hi> but from whom? from <hi>Idolaters?</hi> if from sinners, wee must forsake all, nay, our own flesh: for seeing our <hi>righteousness is but as a menstruous cloth,</hi> where is then our puritie? Thou thinkest thy calling old, but if from thy father <hi>Brown,</hi> thou art but as yesterdaie; but let mee ask thee one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, as <hi>Marie</hi> did the supposed gardener, where hast thou laid thy sinful bodie? go put it on, for I dare not question too much with a spirit lest it should bee evil, and a deceiver.

                           <hi>Answ. The Lord's dear and blessed children, true Catholick Protestants;</hi> And I heartily desire that poor differences betwixt us were once settled and determined of; even, as wee call it, in their trifling <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> (I hope it will bee now.) For shall a <hi>Ceremonie</hi> divide the substance? shall a quarrel about a feather with brethren, (as our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops did) bee an occasion of the cutting of a lim? and the dividing of that Mystical bodie of Jesus Christ asunder for trifles, where there is no dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst brethren: the father will hear it, even so will the Father of us all. Judg the caus of this controversie, but when the father shall see his children com into his presence, and som without ears, and to bee cut off by their brethren for trifles, will hee take it well?</p>
                        <p>Oh! what a grief it is to think that the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> should make such a rent amongst us even like a knife that part's a piece of good stuff: If you see one com into a shop, and make choice of a whole piece of cloth of gold, or cloth of tissue, hee buie's it all, and take's a knife and parts it; the one part hee throw's by and regard's it not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus it pleaseth not him in the branch or wave, yet the stuff is of equal value: even so they cannot
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:204845:71"/>but bee accounted but for the <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> Oh wretched trifles! which signifie nothing to us at all. Manie offences, as they are taken seem greater or less; are they not as much to bee condemned which slight the <hi>King's</hi> Laws and Proclamations? for when the Head and Bodie of the Land have made Laws and proclaimed them, how manie can you finde that can stand up and saie truly, I have conscionably kept them; but take him Devil, if hee denie the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> once. Wee should bee reconcil'd and bee all of one minde; will anie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dislike a dutiful son for his true obedience to him, if hee will make him his heir, though hee strive's to pleas him above his brethren? Or a true, conscionable, faithful, diligent, and careful servant, alwaies striving to pleas his Master in the smallest thing, becaus hee truly fear's and love's him: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, none but disobedient sons, and wicked and slothful servants. It is nothing but the work of the Devil to make us hate those which God love's best, that hee may deprive us of that happiness which hee once injoied.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, let us account them as enemies to our soul's bliss, that withstand the truth; and hold hands with those that truly maintein it.</p>

                        <p>There was never mischief yet plotted against God's Prophets or children, that had authoritie, but still wicked Prophets or wicked Priests were the chiefest agents in that action.</p>

Under correction I think it is not, but rather of those that can and will not, and not of them that would and cannot; for commonly poor Readers have poor livings, and for the most part poor men: though rich Patrons, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> not onely <hi>muzzel the mouth of the ox,</hi> but take awaie that hee should live by; besides, how saith the Prophet
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:204845:73"/>then, they never have enough. Or els it must needs bee, they are not sent of God; for there are but two callings, External and Internal: for els they might answer, Why Lord, teach mee, I beseech thee, as thou didst teach thy blessed Apostles, for thou hast sent mee; and let mee not bee compared to a <hi>dog</hi> the basest of all creatures, <hi>that turn's to his vomit:</hi> Give mee understanding how to teach thy people, as thou didst those that thou hast cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, manie reading Ministers are good Christians which God never called dogs; which make's mee gather it is meant by those which can and will not, or will but when they list: ask anie of these Captains what lesson hee can plaie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, sure hee can plaie nothing but <hi>Hope,</hi> and fum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that too: as when hee think's of this saying, <hi>Cursed is hee that doth the work of the Lord neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently.</hi>

                        <p>But <hi>Balaam</hi> was a wicked Prophet before, and

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes. They taught all alike that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias was com and had <hi>power through his name to cast out Devils, Acts</hi> 1.17. but no further; for <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> had obtained but part of his Ministerie.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, they were all ignorant of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, nay, of the Principles of Religion; of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, without which no man can bee saved.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, they were commanded not to go to the Gentiles, nor to the cities of the Samaritans.</p>

                        <p>But after our blessed Saviour's Passion, hee sent his Apostles, as in the end of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> you may read, <hi>All power is given unto mee</hi> (saith Jesus) <hi>both in heaven and earth.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:204845:74"/>the colors, but more of the adversaries side. So the <hi>Papist</hi> fight's against us: the <hi>Brownist</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth us of Treason, and make's us Rebels: the <hi>Arminian</hi> side's in part with our enemies: and the licentious<note n="*" place="margin">I reckon him as nothing.</note> Captain is not to bee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with a Companie: nay, if hee have one <hi>Achan,</hi> the battle speed's the wors for him.</p>
                        <p>Let mee end now with this friendly and loving Exhortation, both to <hi>Papist, Arminian,</hi> and <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist:</hi> Have you learning joined with love and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie? do you seek the truth unfeignedly from your hearts, with a desire to love everie member of Jesus Christ? can you praie from your hearts for your enemies soul's happiness? fear not, depend upon God, hee will shew you wherein you err.</p>
                        <p>But if you have learning, pride, and envie, and finde your hearts not pliable for repentance; you may com in time to bee Serjeant-Major, but it must bee for the Devil's troop.</p>
                        <p>Thus you see wee have but two sorts; I meddle with no degree above a Captain, <hi>For there is no power but of God;</hi> neither can it stand if not truly grounded by his Word, so no power.</p>
                        <p>For those which bee his enemies hee can quickly cast down; let him alone, the quarrel is his.

Therefore let not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitant contend in anie bitter waie against the non-conformitant, becaus as wee saie, wee differ but in unsignificant Ceremonies. Neither yet let
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:204845:75"/>the non-conformitant in anie invective waie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend against the conformitant, because they both agree in Doctrine.

                     <p>HEre followeth the third and last Branch of the fifth part, which sheweth <hi>who</hi> are to follow their Doctrine and good example; namely Christ's souldiers, his sheep. Lo here the <hi>Banner is given to those that fear God for truth's sake:</hi> O then! none that stand for truth must bee fals.</p>
                     <p>The truth will make us free, then wee must all awaie to truth for shame, which is to God's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors: God's colors are for truth and salvation, the Devils for hell and destruction. God's souldiers for truth, the Devil's against it: God hath his flock, and the Devil his flocks: there are but two<note n="*" place="margin">A looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass for God's soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> waies, the greater part run's wrong; for let God send his Trumpeters to call his Souldiers to his colors, how slow they com? but if the Devil, do but bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them, away they will run.</p>
                     <p>But what is the Devil that so manie strive to serv? or what is hell that so manie labor to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase? surely people cannot bee so much mistaken both in the leader and master of their affections, and likewise of his place and habitation, becaus hee can (think they) change his shape into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light; therefore, think they, his place of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation must needs bee glorious; and that the Scriptures in that point cannot bee true, and men's judgments likewise fail: or els they would never labor with might and main (and think not of God but by waie of profaneness) hazzard both life, health, and substance, to possess that their, much mistaken, place of happiness; for as with God in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:204845:76"/>heaven there is exceedings, exceeding in beautie and glorie, exceeding in blessings and reward, and exceeding in joieous habitation unspeakable.</p>
                     <p>So likewise with the Devils in hell there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but exceeding deformed and uglie which sin make's so; exceeding full of horror and torment; his habitation most noisom, horrible, and cursed, but endless and remediless: Oh <hi>consider this all yee that forget God!</hi> Do the best, and haste to the Lord's colors, lest hee tear you in pieces, when there will bee no redeemer to help you: when hee shall saie, <hi>Depart from mee yee cursed into the place prepared, for I know you not.</hi>

A most gracious promise of a blessed reward to his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:204845:76"/>Souldiers; Christ call's none his but those that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, nay daily follow him: and as hee know's which are his, even so hee hath left us signs to know whether wee bee his or no: wee must bee born again if wee belong to God, wee must bee twice born; our lives must bee quite changed, from evil, to a right endeavouring to all goodness, and earnest laboring to all perfect obedience.</p>
                     <p>The stream of our affections must bee turned another waie, from noisom and rotten ground, to sound and perfect earth.

O let no man rest until hee have got this assurance, that God is his Father, which is seen by true obedience; for heaven is not so easily gotten as manie think it is, with a sigh, a sob, and away. If worldly things must bee both gotten, and kept with care and industrie, which are transitorie, then much more heavenlie which are permanent.</p>
                     <p>It is a blessed thing to bee one of Christ's sheep, to bee guided by him; for as good sheep that are sound are for the King's table; so are those sheep that love the Word of God, for to sit at the King of heaven's table: As those sheep that are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less of their food, becom rotten, and meat for dogs; so those sheep that love 'not sound food, the

                     <p>Now seeing that the truth will make us free, what great comfort doth it bring to those that stand for it, though it bee even to death: our souls are purified in obeying the truth; everie man love's freedom, none desire's bondage, yet most men take the greatest pains to get it; even to bee bond-slaves to Satan, and fire-brands to hell: What pains doth the covetous man take to get his desire, yet never satisfied?</p>
                     <p>The thief in watching when others sleep, hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his end.</p>

                     <p>The gormandising glutton, and swill-bellied drunkard, by their self-murthering surfets, all hasting to their end, to shorten their daies, and hast to their sorrow, without timely repentance.</p>
                     <p>It hath been as rare a thing to see a man drunk as to see a man murthered; but now it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing to see a man murther himself with drunkenness.</p>
                     <p>The Jews would rend their cloaths when they heard one swear, as it is reported; but hee that doth so now, should keep none on his back.</p>
                     <p>One reason is why men are so abominably wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, they do not beleev that God's eie is everie
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:204845:77"/>where beholding the good and the evil; the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of all fail too much in that meditation; the wicked have their heaven in this life, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie their hell; yet though the wicked have their heaven here, the painted'st gallant is but as a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-flie; good for little blown away with a cold blast, if hee want Religion. If one out of a loving desire do exhort one that riot's it so, and adviseth him to go to God's colors for truth, hee would presently answer, would you have mee turn Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? as if it were a dishonor to a gentleman to bee religious: but if you should desire him to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how God hath hired you to serv him behold how brave you go! when manie go almost naked; you fare deliciously when manie cannot get bread; you see how God whip's them, and hire's you to serv him, beethink your selvs: But if you should tell him if hee go not to God's colors, hee is a traitor to him, and a bond-slave to Satan, you should bee sure of a stab if you look not to your self; hee would bee like a hors that hath a gall'd back; bring him a plaster; though you speak him fair and would his good, hee will kick you: or like a mad dog, bring him a medicine to cure him hee would bite you: yet if hee bee clothed in scarlet, hee is poor, naked, and miserable, as a holie man hath writ; there are so manie that are not sensible of their miseries, they are like one sleeping in a rotten hous readie to fall on his head, if the winde should blow; and under his bed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie venomous creatures to sting him; if hee go forth, wilde beasts to devour him: this man's case was miserable, but if no friend to help him, much more: one lovingly com's and adventure's to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:204845:78"/>awake him it may bee, until hee com to himself hee may strike with the elbow; but when hee behold's his danger, hee sure would love that friend: So fare's it with manie that sleep in sin, awake som, and when they bee com to themselvs they will bee thankful; but manie will hate you the more, for you are not a chip of the right block. Everie man will confess that the mad-man, the fool, and the dead-man are all sensless: But if thou beest mad after thy fleshly desires, thou art the mad-man when thou neglectest heaven; if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so wittie for earthlie things, and sottish for thy soul, thou art the fool. If never so quick and nimble after thy business, and spiritually dead, thou art the dead man; Oh bee intreated for thy soul!</p>
                     <p>As wee may not follow the example of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlie, so we may not take encouragement from the infirmities of the Saints. For in the dearest of God's children there is this spiritual combat, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption against grace, and grace against corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and somtimes grace get's the foil; but bee sure make still at the darling sin; let no man think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self pure, but strive to bee so; for com but into a room that is pure and white, and seeming cleanly, not one soul spot to bee discerned; open but the casement when the sun shine's clear, you shall see a world of motes: Even so, when the sun-shine of grace shineth in our hearts, wee shall see our own foulness then; for when wee are left to our own base lusts, wee see onely the glorie of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and beautie of the earth, and no marvel though wee bee taken with the lusts and pleasures thereof. The sheep love's the briar-leaf, and is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:204845:78"/>catcht with the briar for her labor; so it is with us when wee give but waie to our affections; for how can it bee otherwise? such as wee sow such wee must reap; if wee sow cockle, wee cannot look for wheat, nor to prize God's Word as wee ought, but hear it as a tale that is told: but when the Lord hath powred clean water upon us, and washt us from all our filthiness, and all our Idols, and given us a heart of flesh, and breathed his graces in us, then are wee fit to stand for truth; then wee cannot look into the world to set or pitch our affections on it; then will wee die for truth; for hardness of heart was the greatest plague of all the plagues of <hi>Egypt:</hi> for if a man was in a hous all on fire, and his God with him, what then? It was but the sooner to bring him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; or in the mid'st of the raging waters; or had the noisom pestilence, or incurable sore? yet all was not so bad as a hard heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. Yet still God must bee sought for to perform it; God's children praie for tears, true sorrow for sin; which beeing granted, bring's more joie of heart then anie worldly pleasure. God hath given to man reason and understanding above all creatures, to bee in subjection unto him; therefore the more hired to love him and daily to crave for the assistance of his holie Spirit. If wee can prais God, when others serv God better then wee, and desire that wee may serv God better then they, wee are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie: but when wee despise others for their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, wee are yet most wretched. Wee must bee joifeul for the good of others, and sorrowfull for their sins; God commanded <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to set a mark
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:204845:79"/>upon the fore-heads that <hi>mourn for the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that bee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>When the Prodigal childe was com to himself, hee returned to his father; so I heartily desire, that all that are enemies to their own souls, may turn to God's colors and stand for truth, for hee that fight's against it is not com to himself, but is mad: Oh bee intreated for thy self!</p>
                     <p>Know you not that <hi>your bodies are the temples of the holie Ghost?</hi> Where Temples are kept for God's service, they are not onely carefully look't to without, that they may stand, but within: so are wee, much more to look to our bodies, if wee think to entertain that blessed guest. As Christ whipt the bulers and sellers out of his Temple, so must wee whip sin as well out of our temple; hee called it his hous which manie now despise. This may not onely teach us to behave our selvs orderly without, but much more within to bee adorned with heavenly thoughts and meditations, with graceful and Saviour speeches, and wisely to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our selvs with the use of God's creatures; as, in meats and drinks, seeing we have so manie sorts to feed and refresh our selvs withal.</p>
                     <p>Wee must receiv them as wee do gold with the allowance but no further, for when the beam turn's wrong waie, then refuse them; so long as they make us fitter for God's service and our calling, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receiv them; but when they make us anie waie apter after our fleshlie lusts, then the beam turn's wrong, then they are as baits to betraie us; for the Devil com's everie waie hee can devise, when thou wilt abuse thy self by God's creatures:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:204845:79"/>then hee work's thee to bee out of love with those that will not run with thee into the same excess of riot, those which grace hath wrought upon; then hee labor's thee not to seek so much after God's Word; or els to grow out of love with the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and lastly to contemn God's holie Laws, which is not to love God at all: still laboring to bring us to fight under his noisom colors against truth.</p>
                     <p>That man that hath but one hous to entertain his best friend in, and hath an enemie that watcheth daily to get possession of it, if hee com in unawares, hee will surely trie his strength to throw him out by head and shoulders: so wee must keep our hearts for our good God, who will have them for himself, or not at all, and wrestle with him at the beginning, and manfully fight under the banner for truth. For in man is two works; first God's work in creating him; then his own work by sin, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie the end of his creation which began first in <hi>Adam.</hi> If wee <hi>would judg our selvs, wee should not bee judged,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. Judg our selvs, but not so readie to judg others, and learn not of <hi>Adam</hi> to hide our selvs from God, but call a privie sessions in our own hearts, and bring our selvs to the bar, and sift and trie our selvs by God's Word and our own consciences, and prove how the case stand's, guiltie or not; God's Souldiers or the Devil's; do wee stand for truth or stand against it. Answer for thy self, for though no man can number his sins, yet anie man may know his waie of sinning, which waie hee hath been given to offend the Lord in; whether by lust or drunkenness, by pride, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, or the like.</p>
                     <p>Wee must endevour to do as well as wee desire
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:204845:80"/>to do, for if manie bee together, it may bee half of them may detest great sins, but small sins (as wee call them) too few regard; for if a man ow to two thousand men one thousand pounds, the debt is as much as if it were owing to one man; so a world of small sins not truly repented of, may prove wors then one great sin which lie's at the heart and truly mourned for. But small sins are called venial sins; a thief doth not suffer for a pennie, but if hee take manie they may cost him dear: all sins are death to us, but those which our Saviour suffered for, which are those that are truly repented of: let no man deceiv himself.</p>
                     <p>If wee see a poor prisoner condemned before a Judg for stealing or the like, Oh! saie som, that hee had more grace; when somtimes those that saie so are more graceless; hee stand's there before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie spectators, if they would but judg themselvs rightly, they might well lament their own case; for as the Commandements are ranked, so are they in greatness, though hee that will break one is liable to all.</p>
                     <p>For first where Gods command's, thus hee saith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but mee;</hi> thou deniest it not, yet if either by preferring thy riches, in love to them, before the glorie of God, or takest more delight in earthlie vanities then in thy God; thou art yet wors then the thief.</p>
                     <p>Secondly <hi>If thou committest Idolatrie</hi> by the fals worship of God; Thou art wors then the thief.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>If thou take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain</hi> by swearing or fals-swearing, as <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dammees</hi> use to do; Thou art yet wors then the thief</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>If thou keepest not the Lords-daie holie,</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:204845:80"/>the Lord's Sabbath, and constrainest not them that are under thee of thy hous to do the like; Thou art yet wors then the thief.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>If thou beest disobedient to parents;</hi> thou art yet wors then the thief.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, <hi>If thou beest anie waie a murtherer;</hi> Thou art yet wors then the thief.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, <hi>If thou committest adulterie,</hi> as the thief stand's onely accused for theft; Thou art yet wors then the thief.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, if thou beest proud and ambitious; Thou art yet wors then the thief: for manie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, for pride, were cast out of heaven; when our Saviour took the penitent thief to heaven with him; a fair looking-glass for proud men. And if thou consumest thy patrimonie, thou overthrowest thy posteritie, and art wors then the thief.</p>
                     <p>And if thou beest a scorner of Religion and Holiness, thou art a traitor to truth, and so to thy God, and to thy soul; thou art the Devil's steward, and wors then anie thief.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, if the old saying bee true, as true it is, if thou beest a liar, thou art wors then the thief, for a liar cannot call God father: <hi>For you are of your father the Divel,</hi> saith our Saviour Jesus Christ, <hi>John</hi> 8.44.</p>
                     <p>And if a thief deserv's death, even so do all that break the fore-going Commandements much more. I frame not this speech anie waie to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance a thief for there are but few theevs that make conscience of the Commandements; but to teach us, when wee see them condemned, to look to our selvs.</p>
                     <p>And to conclude, if a Souldier run from his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:204845:81"/>colors to the enemies, hee must have Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Law; for if a King have a Subject that live's under another King or Prince, that is an enemie to him; if hee send for him, and hee refuse to com, then hee send's his Proclamation, and denying that, hee stand's a traitor, until hee hath procured a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: so it is with all that stout it so with God, and refuse to com to his colors, slighting his dailie Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, spurning at his Commandements, and make their destruction their great delight, and murther their own souls. This may serv everie one to examine himself by, whose souldier hee is, and though poorly, yet truly and plainly proved who are yet traitors and the enemies best friends, <hi>For God hath given a Banner to them that fear him, that it may bee displaied becaus of the truth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>O Most glorious and everlasting Lord God, which inhabitest eternitie, and dwellest in that light which no mortal eie can attain unto; the God in whom wee live, move, and have our beeing: wee thine unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie servants do here in lowliness and humilitie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent our praiers and persons before thy divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie; confessing and acknowledging that wee were conceived in sin and brought forth in iniquitie, and, as it had been but a small matter, wee have heaped up our actual transgressions as the sands upon the sea shore, and as the stars in the firmament for number. Wee have broken thy Commandements, wee have wounded our own consciences, and weakened our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of salvation, and grieved thy good Spirit which sealeth us up to the daie of our redemption. And now holie Father, if thou shouldest deal with us after our deservings, thou maiest powr upon us the deluge of thy wrath and furie, to sweep us out of the land of the living into that place of torments, prepared for the devil and his angels. But thou hast revealed thy self unto the sons of men, to bee the Lord; merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and of great goodness, one that pardonest sin, and passest by the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy people; this is thy name for ever, and thy memorial throughout all generations. Wee appeal therefore from thee, unto thee; from the bar of thy Justice to the bowels of thy Mercie; beseeching thee for Jesus Christ his sake to bee merciful unto us,
<pb facs="tcp:204845:82"/>in the free pardon and forgivness of all our sins that ever wee have committed against thee: And now ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father, seeing the night is upon us, and wee are readie to take our rest, wee commit our souls into thy hands, and our bodies, and all that wee have, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee which art the keeper of Israel, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sleepest nor slumberest, to take care of us; for if thou protect us not, Sathan will rule over us, wee shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and never rise up to prais thee. Wee praie thee therefore bee good to us this night, defend us from danger, refresh us with comfortable sleep, and rais us up to glorifie thee in the due time of the daie following. And when it shall pleas thee to cast us upon the bed of sickness, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass is about with the sorrows of the grave, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee for thy Name's sake, and for thy Mercies sake, for thy Son Jesus Christ his sake, not to bee far from us in thee needful time of trouble, when wee shall finde heaviness in our flesh, and there will bee none to deliver us; but bee about our beds, to pardon our sins, pacifie our consciences, strengthen our faith to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate our pains, and receiv our souls which shall bee commended unto thee; receiv them, Father, who hast created them; receiv them, O God the Son, for thou hast redeemed them; receiv them, O God the holie Ghost, for thou hast sanctified them; receiv them, O holie, blessed, and glorious Trinitie, that beeing trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated out of this vale of miserie, wee may live and reign with thee, now everliving and immortal God. in the kingdom of glorie world without end,</hi> Amen.</p>
